//! Startup auto-recovery for AI agent sessions.
//!
//! After a system reboot, tmux loses all its sessions. AoE sessions whose
//! agent supports `--resume <sid>` (claude, opencode, codex, gemini, vibe,
//! pi, hermes, kiro, qwen) can be transparently recreated by replaying the
//! resume cascade in `start_with_resume_fallback`. This module centralises
//! the candidate selection and the cross-process exclusion needed to make
//! that safe when both the TUI (`aoe`) and the daemon (`aoe serve`) are
//! running.
//!
//! The recovery cascade itself lives in `instance::start_with_resume_fallback`;
//! this module is the policy layer (who runs it, when, with what serialization)
//! that the TUI and daemon entry points share.
//!
//! # Cross-process exclusion
//!
//! Both the TUI and the daemon may attempt recovery on startup. To avoid
//! duplicate cascades against the same `(profile, id)` (which would race on
//! `tmux new-session` and on `sessions.json`), we acquire a non-blocking
//! exclusive `flock` on a marker file in the app data directory. The losing
//! party skips recovery entirely and lets the winner proceed. The file lock
//! is held for the entire recovery pass so that:
//!
//! - A late-starting daemon cannot duplicate a TUI's in-flight workers.
//! - A late-starting TUI cannot duplicate a daemon's in-flight workers.
//!
//! `daemon_pid()` alone is not sufficient because the daemon writes its PID
//! file *after* fork+exec, leaving a tens-to-hundreds-of-millisecond window
//! where both sides observe "no daemon running" and both decide they own
//! recovery.
//!
//! # Hung-hook caveat (cross-process consequence)
//!
//! `restart_with_size_opts` runs the agent's `on_launch` hooks (`npm install`,
//! `nvm use`, env setup, etc.) inline. If a hook hangs (interactive prompt,
//! deadlocked subprocess), the recovery worker's `spawn_blocking` thread
//! cannot be cancelled (`tokio::time::timeout` on the `JoinHandle` does not
//! interrupt the underlying OS thread), so the worker holds its semaphore
//! permit indefinitely AND the cross-process file lock above is never
//! released. A peer process started after the hang is locked out of recovery
//! for the entire daemon uptime; the only mitigation today is "hooks must be
//! non-interactive and complete in <30s". Hardening is tracked as a follow-up
//! (graceful timeout + force-kill path on the cascade).

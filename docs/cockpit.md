# Cockpit (Native Agent Rendering)

Cockpit is aoe's native rendering surface for AI coding agents. Instead
of viewing the agent through a terminal pane (PTY bytes piped through
xterm.js), cockpit renders the agent's structured state directly: plan,
tool calls, diffs, and approvals. It's mobile-first, with a desktop
layout that scales the same components into a richer multi-pane view.

Cockpit speaks the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/)
(ACP), a JSON-RPC standard for editor-agent communication. aoe is the
*client*; the agent (Anthropic's Claude Code, our `aoe-agent`, Google's
Gemini CLI, etc.) is the *server*. Any ACP-conformant agent works.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Confirm prerequisites: aoe, Node.js >= 20, claude login.
aoe cockpit doctor

# 2. Create a Claude Code session in cockpit mode.
aoe add . --cmd claude --cockpit

# 3. Open the dashboard, pick the session, and you should see the
#    structured plan + tool-call cards instead of a terminal.
aoe serve
```

A first-time mobile user pointed at a remote `aoe serve` will install
the PWA, tap the session, and see the plan panel render the moment the
agent emits its first plan event.

## Requirements

- aoe 1.5.0 or newer, built with `--features cockpit`.
- Node.js 20 or newer on `PATH`. Cockpit spawns an ACP agent
  subprocess; for the bundled `aoe-agent` runtime it uses Vercel AI
  SDK 6, which requires Node 20+.
- For Claude Code via the official ACP adapter, you also need a
  `claude login` session.

If Node.js is missing or too old, cockpit refuses to start and prints
an actionable error pointing at the install path for your OS.

### Verify

```bash
aoe cockpit doctor
```

Sample output on a clean machine:

```
Cockpit doctor
==============

[OK] Node runtime  v22.21.0
    path: /opt/homebrew/bin/node

Configured agents:
[OK] aoe-agent      aoe's multi-provider agent (Vercel AI SDK 6)
[OK] claude-code    Anthropic Claude via the official ACP adapter

Overall: ok
```

If Node is missing the report exits 1; if some agents are unreachable
it exits 2; otherwise 0. Pass `--json` for machine-readable output.

## Enabling cockpit

### Per session

```bash
# Force cockpit on for this session, regardless of defaults.
aoe add . --cmd claude --cockpit

# Force terminal/PTY on, regardless of defaults.
aoe add . --cmd claude --no-cockpit

# Pick a specific cockpit agent + model.
aoe add . --cockpit --agent aoe-agent --model gpt-5
aoe add . --cockpit --agent aoe-agent --model llama3.3:ollama
aoe add . --cockpit --agent gemini
```

### Globally

The settings live in `config.toml` under `[cockpit]`:

```toml
[cockpit]
enabled = true
default_for_claude = true
default_agent = "aoe-agent"
approval_timeout_secs = 300
destructive_require_double_confirm = true
max_concurrent_workers = 5
replay_events = 500
replay_bytes = 5_242_880
node_path = ""
```

`enabled = false` is a master kill switch; cockpit refuses to spawn
even if a session has `--cockpit`. `default_for_claude = true` makes
new Claude sessions cockpit-mode by default on mobile clients.

Migration v005 seeds these defaults on upgrade so the section already
exists if you came from 1.4.x.

## Disabling / escape hatches

- `--no-cockpit` per session.
- `cockpit.enabled = false` in `config.toml` (global).
- `AOE_NO_COCKPIT=1` env var, applied at process start.
- `AOE_COCKPIT_NODE=/path/to/node` overrides Node discovery for one
  process (useful when the host's PATH-side Node is the wrong version
  and you can't change PATH).

## Tool compatibility

| Tool          | Cockpit?     | Notes                                              |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Claude Code   | yes          | via the official ACP adapter (`claude-code`)        |
| aoe-agent     | yes          | bundled multi-provider runtime (Vercel AI SDK 6)   |
| Gemini CLI    | yes          | `gemini acp` (Google reference impl)               |
| OpenCode      | optional     | requires `opencode` with ACP support               |
| Codex CLI     | optional     | tracking upstream ACP support                      |
| Cursor CLI    | terminal only| no ACP support today                               |
| Factory Droid | terminal only| no ACP support today                               |
| OpenClaw      | terminal only| no ACP support today                               |

Tools without ACP support continue to work exactly as they do today
(tmux + PTY); cockpit is additive, not a replacement.

## Approvals

When the agent wants to run a tool that requires approval, the cockpit
shows an approval card:

- **Benign tools** (read, search, list): single tap on a primary
  button.
- **Destructive tools** (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, writes to
  system paths): long-press 800ms with a progress ring and a haptic
  confirmation. Single tap is reserved for the deny button.

You can configure how cockpit classifies destructive operations and
the timeout before a pending approval auto-cancels:

```toml
[cockpit]
approval_timeout_secs = 300
destructive_require_double_confirm = true
```

## Security

- File system access uses ACP's `fs/read_text_file` and
  `fs/write_text_file`. Agents do **not** access the disk directly; aoe
  reads/writes on their behalf and enforces sandbox roots (the
  session's worktree + any explicit `--repo` paths).
- Terminal commands use ACP's `terminal/*`. The shell command runs in
  aoe's process, in the session's worktree (or sandboxed Docker
  container if applicable).
- Approval nonces are server-generated and single-use. A compromised
  agent process cannot synthesise approvals; aoe never reveals the
  nonce to the agent.
- Auth tokens (`AOE_TOKEN`) are explicitly *not* forwarded to the
  agent subprocess.

## Troubleshooting

### `aoe cockpit doctor` says Node is missing

Install Node.js 20 or newer:

- macOS: `brew install node`
- Linux: `apt install nodejs` or `nvm install 20`
- Windows: download from <https://nodejs.org/>

Then re-run `aoe cockpit doctor` to verify. If you have Node installed
in a non-standard location, set `AOE_COCKPIT_NODE=/path/to/node` or
configure `cockpit.node_path` in `config.toml`.

### `aoe cockpit doctor` says aoe-agent is missing

`aoe-agent` ships with the aoe binary. If the doctor reports it
missing, your install is incomplete. Reinstall aoe via your package
manager (e.g., `brew reinstall aoe`).

### `aoe cockpit doctor` says claude-code adapter is missing

Install the official adapter once:

```bash
npm install -g @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp
```

Then run `claude login` if you haven't already.

### Cockpit feels "stuck" with no events

- Check `aoe cockpit logs --follow` (when the worker supervisor lands)
  to see worker stderr.
- Check the dashboard's connection chrome at the top of the cockpit
  view; it shows reconnect status if the WebSocket is degraded.
- If you see a `lagged` notice, refresh the page to request a fresh
  snapshot.

### Approval card vanished without resolving

Approvals expire after `approval_timeout_secs` (default 300). The
agent receives a structured cancellation; you'll typically see a
follow-up message asking again. Bump the timeout if you're in a
context where approvals legitimately take longer.

## CLI reference

```
aoe cockpit doctor [--json] [--fix]
aoe cockpit agents
aoe cockpit logs [--session <id>] [--follow]
aoe cockpit restart <session>
```

`logs` and `restart` are reserved for the worker supervisor wiring
(landing in a follow-up release); they print a clear "not yet
available" message today so scripts can check the surface stably.

## What's deferred

These are tracked for follow-up releases:

- Mid-token interrupt (waiting on Anthropic's stable feature).
- Plan-mode and elicitation event mappings (the SDK supports them; the
  cockpit's typed schema covers the common path).
- Cross-agent handoff and unified search across cockpit sessions.
- Voice input/output on mobile.
- Auto-download of bundled Node runtime at first use (today aoe
  expects Node on PATH; the resolution path supports a bundled
  runtime once the auto-download lands).
- Docker sandbox unix-socket transport for cockpit sessions running
  inside containers.

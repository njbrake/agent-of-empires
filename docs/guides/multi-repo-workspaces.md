# Multi-Repo Workspaces

Run a single AoE session across several git repositories at once. Each repo gets its own worktree on a shared branch name, all rooted under one workspace directory, attached to one tmux session.

Use this when a unit of work, a feature, a bug fix, an investigation, touches more than one repo and you want one agent driving all of them, not N agents you have to mentally reconcile.

## When to Use

| Scenario | Multi-repo? |
|---|---|
| Bug spans backend and frontend repos | Yes |
| Refactor across an OSS core and a private wrapper | Yes |
| Feature limited to a single repo | No, regular session |
| Investigating logs that touch many repos | Yes, agent picks the relevant ones |
| OSS core is pinned and rarely changes | Use [`on_create` hooks](repo-config.md) instead |

## Quick Start

### 1. Register your repos once

```bash
aoe project add /path/to/backend
aoe project add /path/to/frontend
aoe project add /path/to/shared-lib
```

`aoe project list` shows what is registered.

### 2. Start a multi-repo session

CLI:

```bash
aoe add /path/to/backend \
  --project frontend \
  --project shared-lib \
  -w feat/auth-rewrite -b
```

TUI: open the new-session dialog (`n`), enter the worktree branch, focus the **Extra Repos** field, press `Ctrl+R`, and pick the registered projects you want to include.

Web: `+ New session`, pick a primary repo, then click registered projects in the **Extra repos** picker (or paste a path with the free-text input).

### 3. The agent sees one workspace

The session starts in the workspace root with all the worktrees as siblings:

```
~/aoe-workspaces/feat-auth-rewrite/
├── backend/      ← branch feat/auth-rewrite
├── frontend/     ← branch feat/auth-rewrite
└── shared-lib/   ← branch feat/auth-rewrite
```

The agent navigates between them like any normal multi-repo working tree. Use `cd` and standard git commands; AoE does not impose any cross-repo orchestration.

## The Project Registry

Saved repo paths the multi-repo pickers draw from. Two scopes:

| Scope | File | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| Global | `<app_dir>/projects.json` | Every profile |
| Profile | `<app_dir>/profiles/{profile}/projects.json` | Only that profile |

`<app_dir>` is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-of-empires/` on Linux, `~/.agent-of-empires/` on macOS.

When both scopes hold the same canonical path, the **profile entry wins** in merged views (this is how `--allow-override` is meant to be used: stage a profile-specific name on top of a global default).

### Default scope

| Invocation | Default scope |
|---|---|
| `aoe project add <path>` | Global |
| `aoe -p <profile> project add <path>` | Profile |

Pass `--scope global` or `--scope profile` to override.

### Cross-scope collisions

```bash
aoe project add /repo/foo                     # global
aoe -p other project add /repo/foo            # ERROR: same path in global scope
aoe -p other project add /repo/foo --allow-override  # OK, profile shadows global
```

## CLI Reference

```bash
# List
aoe project list                       # merged (global + active profile)
aoe project list --scope global        # globals only
aoe project list --scope profile       # active profile only
aoe project list --json                # machine-readable

# Add
aoe project add /path/to/repo                          # global, name = basename
aoe project add /path/to/repo --name shortname        # custom display name
aoe project add /path/to/repo --scope profile         # profile-only
aoe project add /path/to/repo --allow-override        # shadow other-scope entry

# Remove
aoe project remove backend                # by name (case-insensitive)
aoe project remove /path/to/repo          # by canonical path
aoe project remove backend --scope profile

# Use in a session
aoe add /path/to/primary --project name1 --project name2 -w branch -b
aoe add /path/to/primary --repo /literal/path --project registered -w branch -b
```

`--repo` and `--project` may be mixed; the union is passed to the workspace builder. The builder rejects duplicate repo names, so the same repo via two paths is a hard error.

`aoe list --json` includes a `workspace_repos` array for each session; the array is empty for single-repo sessions.

## Web Dashboard

The Projects page (folder icon in the sidebar footer) is full CRUD over the registry: add, remove, switch scope, opt into `allow_override`. Read-only servers (`aoe serve --read-only`) hide the destructive controls.

The new-session wizard surfaces the registry as toggleable chips on the Project step. The free-text input still works for paths that aren't registered.

Multi-repo sessions are bucketed into a single **Multi-repo** group at the bottom of the sidebar, regardless of which repo was chosen as the primary. Each session row shows a chip per repo under the title.

## Limitations

These are out of scope for the current release; tracked separately:

- **One branch name per workspace**: every repo gets the same `-w <branch>` value. Per-repo branch names is a future feature.
- **No agent-driven repo pull-in mid-session**: if the agent realizes it needs another repo, you have to start a new session. Tracked alongside the orchestrator work.
- **No saved workspace templates** ("named bundles of repos"): each session picks the set fresh. If your bundle is fixed, register the repos and select them all from the picker.
- **No per-repo PR tracking**: AoE does not track PRs today. Coordinated PR workflow happens outside AoE.

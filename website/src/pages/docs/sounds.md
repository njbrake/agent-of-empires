description: Configure audio feedback for agent state transitions in Agent of Empires.
---

Agent of Empires can play sound effects when agent sessions change state, providing audio feedback for transitions like starting, running, waiting, idle, and error states.

## Features

- State transition sounds (start, running, waiting, idle, error)
- Multiple installation options (bundled, AoE II extraction, custom)
- Fully customizable - use any .wav/.ogg files
- Configurable via Settings TUI
- Per-transition sound overrides
- Random or specific sound modes

## Quick Start

1. **Install sounds**:
   ```bash
   aoe sounds install
   ```
   This downloads and installs CC0 fantasy/RPG sounds from GitHub to your config directory.

2. **Enable sounds in settings**:
   - Launch `aoe` (TUI mode)
   - Press `s` to open Settings
   - Navigate to the Sound category
   - Enable sounds

3. **Test it**: Start an agent session and listen for the transition sounds!

## Available Sounds

Agent of Empires can download 10 CC0 (public domain) fantasy/RPG sound effects from GitHub:

### Default State Transition Sounds
- `start.wav` - Spell fire sound (session starting)
- `running.wav` - Blade sound (agent actively working)
- `waiting.wav` - Misc sound (agent waiting for input)
- `idle.wav` - Book sound (agent idle)
- `error.wav` - Roar sound (error occurred)

### Additional Variety Sounds
- `spell.wav` - Alternative spell/magic effect
- `coins.wav` - Coin/reward sound
- `metal.wav` - Metal impact sound
- `chain.wav` - Chain/lock sound
- `gem.wav` - Gem/crystal sound

All sounds are from the [80 CC0 RPG SFX](https://opengameart.org/content/80-cc0-rpg-sfx) pack by SubspaceAudio.

## Installation

### Install Sounds from GitHub

```bash
aoe sounds install
```

This downloads and installs 10 CC0 (public domain) fantasy/RPG sounds from the GitHub repository to:
- Linux: `~/.config/agent-of-empires/sounds/`
- macOS: `~/.agent-of-empires/sounds/`

**Note:** Requires an internet connection for the initial download. Sounds are downloaded from:
`https://github.com/njbrake/agent-of-empires/tree/main/bundled_sounds`

### Useful Commands

**Check installed sounds:**
```bash
aoe sounds list
```

**Test a sound:**
```bash
aoe sounds test start
```

## Sound Modes

### Random Mode (default)
Picks a random sound from your sounds directory for each transition.

### Specific Mode
Always plays the same sound file. Useful if you want one signature sound for all transitions.

## Configuration

### Global Settings
Configure sounds for all profiles:
1. Launch `aoe` TUI
2. Press `s` for Settings
3. Select "Sound" category
4. Configure:
   - **Enabled**: Turn sounds on/off
   - **Mode**: Random or Specific
   - **Per-transition overrides**: Set specific sounds for each state

### Profile Settings
Override sound settings per profile:
1. In Settings, toggle to "Profile" scope (top-right)
2. Configure sound overrides for this profile only

### TOML Configuration

You can also edit configuration files directly:

**Global**: `~/.config/agent-of-empires/config.toml` (Linux) or `~/.agent-of-empires/config.toml` (macOS)

```toml
[sound]
enabled = true
mode = "random"
on_error = "error"  # Use specific sound for errors
```

**Profile**: `~/.config/agent-of-empires/profiles/<profile>/config.toml`

```toml
[sound]
enabled = true
on_start = "spell"
on_running = "metal"
on_error = "error"
```

## Custom Sounds

Add your own sounds to `~/.config/agent-of-empires/sounds/`:

1. **Supported formats**: `.wav`, `.ogg`
2. **File naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `wololo.wav`, `rogan.ogg`)
3. **Reference in config**: Use the filename without extension

Example:
```bash
# Linux
cp ~/Downloads/wololo.wav ~/.config/agent-of-empires/sounds/

# Then in settings, set "On Start" to "wololo"
```

## Audio Playback

Sounds are played using platform-native audio players:
- **macOS**: `afplay`
- **Linux**: `aplay` (ALSA) or `paplay` (PulseAudio)

If sounds don't play, ensure you have audio tools installed:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install alsa-utils pulseaudio-utils

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S alsa-utils pulseaudio
```

## Troubleshooting

**Sounds not playing?**
- **SSH Session**: Audio doesn't work over SSH - you need a local terminal with speakers/headphones
- Check that sound files exist in `~/.config/agent-of-empires/sounds/`
- Verify sounds are enabled in Settings
- Test audio with: `aplay ~/.config/agent-of-empires/sounds/start.wav` (Linux)
- Check logs: `AGENT_OF_EMPIRES_DEBUG=1 aoe`

**Want Age of Empires II sounds?**
If you own AoE II, manually copy the taunt files to your sounds directory.

**Custom sounds aren't listed?**
- Ensure files have `.wav` or `.ogg` extension
- Check file permissions are readable
- Restart the TUI to refresh the sound list

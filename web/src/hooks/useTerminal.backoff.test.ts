// Unit tests for retryDelayMs. The function drives the WS reconnect
// backoff schedule. A regression here would either hammer a dead server
// or stretch the first retry past the user-perceptible threshold.
//
// Schedule was tightened from the old exponential curve (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s,
// 16s, 30s, 30s; worst case ~91s) to a fast-start array (200ms, 400ms,
// 800ms, 1.5s, 3s, 6s, 10s; worst case ~22s) to absorb tmux warm-up
// during first-session-open without keeping the client asleep on a 30s
// timer once the server is finally ready. See #1455.

/** Which "worker stopped" banner variant to render in the cockpit
 *  view, given the session's triage state. The variant matches the
 *  reason the worker was torn down so the user sees a banner that
 *  actually explains their situation (and offers the right next
 *  step) instead of the generic `aoe cockpit stop` message. See
 *  #1581.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *   - `"none"`     : worker is not stopped, no banner.
 *   - `"archived"` : worker was torn down by the sidebar archive
 *                    action; reconnect is not the right next step
 *                    (the user must unarchive first).
 *   - `"snoozed"`  : worker was torn down by the sidebar snooze
 *                    action; the reconciler will respawn it when
 *                    the snooze expires.
 *   - `"generic"`  : everything else (`aoe cockpit stop`, manual
 *                    teardown, etc.).
 *
 *  `startupError` takes precedence over every "stopped" banner
 *  variant because the startup-error banner has its own retry path;
 *  callers should bail before invoking this helper when a startup
 *  error is in flight, but we still defensively return `"none"` to
 *  stay safe under refactors. */

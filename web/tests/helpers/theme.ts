// Shared helpers for theme-switching story specs (#1405).
//
// Two domains:
//
//   - `seedCustomTheme(home, name, body)` writes a TOML file into the
//     isolated $HOME so that an `aoe serve` boot picks it up via
//     `discover_custom_themes` (src/tui/styles/mod.rs:86). The themes
//     directory lives at `${appDir}/themes/`, where `appDir` is
//     `${home}/.agent-of-empires-dev` (macOS/Windows) or
//     `${xdg}/agent-of-empires-dev/` (Linux). `appDirFor` in
//     `aoeServe.ts` already mirrors that resolution.
//
//   - `readThemeFromDocument(page)` snapshots the four observable
//     side-effects of `applyResolvedTheme` (web/src/lib/theme.ts:47):
//     `dataset.theme`, `dataset.themeAppearance`, the `color-scheme`
//     style, and one representative CSS variable. Used by the failure
//     and color-mode stories to assert a precise "did NOT paint" state.
